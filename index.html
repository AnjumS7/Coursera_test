                        The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, 
                        a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one 
                        of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population 
                        of 23.7 billion as of 2018.[1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] 
                        There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.
                        [2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their 
                        meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting 
                        or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic
                        period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[3][4] Genetic studies have pointed to multiple 
                        maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but with the 
                        clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in
                        the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to 
                        Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl had 
                        been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives 
                        birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, 
                        Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose 
                        In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily 
                        known as cocks, whereas in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, 
                        they are more commonly called roosters. Males less than a year old are cockerels.
                        [10] Castrated or neutered roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical 
                        castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old 
                        are known as hens, and younger females as pullets,[11] although in the egg-laying 
                        industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of age. 
                        In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic 
                        term chook /tʃʊk/ to describe all ages and both sexes.[12] The young are often 
                        called chicks. Chicken originally referred to young domestic fowl.[13] The species 
                        as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of chicken survives 
                        in the phrase Hen and Chickens, sometimes used as a British public house or theatre 
                        name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea 
                        (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).In the Deep South of the United States, 
                        chickens are referred to by the slang term yardbird.[14] 
                        Chickens are omnivores.[15] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for 
                        seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[16] or young mice.[17]
                        The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed.[18] The world's 
                        oldest known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according 
                        to the Guinness World Records.[19] Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by 
                        their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks
                        (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than
                        those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright 
                        chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as 
                        the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually 
                        from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain 
                        hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult 
                        chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and 
                        hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, 
                        these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. 
                        Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these 
                        are more prominent in males. A muff or beard is a mutation found in several chicken 
                        breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance 
                        of a beard. Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although 
                        lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over 
                        fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally 
                        fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived 
                        danger. Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens belong to, is directly linked to 
                        the survival of birds when all other dinosaurs went extinct. Water or ground-dwelling 
                        fowl, similar to modern partridges, survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 
                        that killed all tree-dwelling birds and dinosaurs.[36] Some of these evolved into the 
                        modern galliformes, of which domesticated chickens are a main model. They are descended 
                        primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are scientifically classified as 
                        the same species.[37] As such, they can and do freely interbreed with populations of 
                        red junglefowl.[37] Subsequent hybridization of domestic chicken with grey junglefowl, 
                        Sri Lankan junglefowl and green junglefowl occurred[38] with at least, a gene for yellow 
                        skin was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the grey junglefowl 
                        (G. sonneratii).[39] In a study published in 2020, it was found that chickens shared 
                        between 71% - 79% of their genome with red junglefowl with domestication period dated 
                        to 8,000 years ago.[38. Red Junglefowl hen in India. The traditional view is that chickens 
                        were first domesticated for cockfighting in Asia, Africa, and Europe.[3] In the last decade, 
                        there have been a number of genetic studies to clarify the origins. According to one early 
                        study, a single domestication event which took place in what now is the country of Thailand
                        gave rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[40] 
                        However, that study was later found to be based on incomplete data, and recent studies 
                        point to multiple maternal origins, with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, 
                        Middle East, and Africa, originating from the Indian subcontinent, where a large number 
                        of unique haplotypes occur.[41][42] The red junglefowl, known as the bamboo fowl in 
                        many Southeast Asian languages, is a special bird well-adapted to take advantage of 
                        the large amounts of fruits that are produced during the end of the 50-year bamboo 
                        seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction.[43] In domesticating the chicken, humans 
                        took advantage of this predisposition for prolific reproduction of the red junglefowl 
                        when exposed to large amounts of food.[44] Several controversies still surround the time 
                        chicken was domesticated. A recent molecular evidence obtained from whole-genome study 
                        published in 2020 reveal that chicken was domesticated 8,000 years ago.[38] Though, it 
                        was previously thought to have been domesticated in Southern China in 6000 BC based on 
                        paleoclimatic assumptions[45] which has now raised doubts from another study that 
                        question whether those birds were the ancestors of chickens today.[46] Majority of the 
                        world chicken today may have migrated from the Harappan culture of the Indus Valley. 
                        Eventually, the chicken moved to the Tarim basin of central Asia. The chicken reached 
                        Europe (Romania, Turkey, Greece, Ukraine) about 3000 BC.[47] Introduction into Western 
                        Europe came far later, about the 1st millennium BC. Phoenicians spread chickens along 
                        the Mediterranean coasts as far as Iberia. Breeding increased under the Roman Empire, 
                        and was reduced in the Middle Ages.[47] Genetic sequencing of chicken bones from 
                        archaeological sites in Europe revealed that in the High Middle Ages chickens became 
                        less aggressive and began to lay eggs earlier in the breeding season.[48]
                        
                        Middle East traces of chicken go back to a little earlier than 2000 BC, in Syria; 
                        chickens went southward only in the 1st millennium BC. They reached Egypt for purposes 
                        of cockfighting about 1400 BC, and became widely bred only in Ptolemaic Egypt 
                        (about 300 BC).[47] Little is known about the chicken's introduction into Africa. 
                        It was during the Hellenistic period (4th-2nd centuries BC), in the Southern Levant, 
                        that chickens began widely to be domesticated for food.[4] This change occurred at 
                        least 100 years before domestication of chickens spread to Europe.
                        
                        Three possible routes of introduction in about the early first millennium AD could 
                        have been through the Egyptian Nile Valley, the East Africa Roman-Greek or Indian 
                        trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers, across the Sahara. The earliest known remains 
                        are from Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and South Africa and date back to the middle of the 
                        first millennium AD.[47] Domestic chicken in the Americas before Western contact is still 
                        an ongoing discussion, but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, 
                        suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens.[47 A lack of data from Thailand, 
                        Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult 
                        to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description 
                        and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by extinction may also help with research 
                        into this area.[47]
